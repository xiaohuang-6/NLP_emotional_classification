it’s the silence before the panic that terrifies me most.;fear
everything is slipping through my hands and i can’t stop it.;fear
i wonder if everyone feels this fear or if it’s just me.;fear
it’s the silence before the panic that terrifies me most.;fear

i can’t tell what’s real fear and what’s just my mind.;fear
sometimes i feel like i’m just watching my life fall apart.;fear
sometimes i feel like i’m just watching my life fall apart.;fear
